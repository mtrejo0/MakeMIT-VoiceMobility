# MakeMIT-VoiceMobility

## Project Description
Voice Mobility is meant to be a representation of what milibity for disabled people can use in the future. We developed an app and car system to take in voice cammands through an app and repliate these commands on a car. 


## Function
This project is accompanied with a mobile app. The mobile app uses Googles Speech to Text API to turn your voice commands into 4 categories: forward, backwards, left and right. These messages are posted to our server. The unit then grabs the commands  from our ser ver and performs them one after another.

## Video
